  method = c("replace", "impute"),
  div = NULL,
  rdist = c("runif", "point")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{method}{(Optional) The method of zero-replacement to switch to}

\item{div}{(Optional) The divisor by which to divide the lowest count value by}

\item{rdist}{(Optional) How to replace zeros, either using a uniform distribution
or a point value
to determine the maximum value to replace zeros with for the "replace" method}
}

Does not return anything

\description{
Cycles between two options for dealing with zero counts:
    - replace: Replacing zero counts with a value between 1/100 and 1/10 of the minimum count value
    - impute: Use zCompositions package to impute a distribution of values to replace zeros
