\title{Cumulative sum scaling percentile selection}
\usage{
mvcumNormStatFast(mat, pFlag = FALSE, rel = 0.1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{Abundance table with samples as columns and features as rows}

\item{pFlag}{Plot the median difference quantiles.}

\item{rel}{Cutoff for the relative difference from one median difference
from the reference to the next.}

\item{...}{Applicable if pFlag == TRUE. Additional plotting parameters.}
}
\value{
Percentile for which to scale data
}
\description{
Calculates the percentile for which to sum counts up to and scale by. Faster
version than available in cumNormStat. Deviates from methods described in Nature Methods by
making use of ro means for reference.
}
\examples{

data(mouseData)
p = round(cumNormStatFast(mouseData,pFlag=FALSE),digits=2)

}
